# Python-Automation-projects
This repository is a collection of Python scripting and automation projects built to extract, process, and transform data from real-world sources. The projects are focused on web scraping, PDF parsing, data cleaning, and automated reporting. They highlight how Python can reduce manual effort and streamline repetitive workflows.

## Purpose 
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how Python can be applied to real-world automation tasks. Each project shows a different aspect of automation â€” from downloading and parsing PDF reports, to scraping live websites, to structuring data into usable formats.

The key goals are:

To automate repetitive tasks that would otherwise require manual effort.

To extract insights from unstructured sources such as PDFs and websites.

To provide reusable templates for common automation workflows like scraping, parsing, and reporting.

To highlight the versatility of Python for solving problems across industries, including finance, transportation, and business reporting.
